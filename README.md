# Cache
It a cache project designed and implemented by Qitao Xu.

## Get, Set, GetMultiple, SetMultiple, Delete

They all have been implemented in LRUCache.py file. 

## Disk and Database Persistence

Currently I do not find a good way to serialize and deserialize Cache, but I do reserve API for those functions.

## Add TTL
It has been added in LRUCache.py file.

## Python Client
